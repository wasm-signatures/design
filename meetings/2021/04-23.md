## Meeting Notes

*   WASI suggested we go through their formal proposal process. [Roadmap](https://github.com/wasm-signatures/design/issues/1)
    *   Starts with creating a proposal in WebAssebly/design [https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1413](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1413)
    *   Please add support and discussion there!
    *   The proposal specification lives on [https://github.com/wasm-signatures/design](https://github.com/wasm-signatures/design) 
*   Project Oak -- would be nice to have contact for their requirements
*   **Please comment on the proposal [issue](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1413)!**
*   Multiple signature discussion
*   Multiple modules, one is a language runtime (re-used), and then the app that re-uses the language. Today we statically link and may sign the whole. But later, a higher level host may want to link the modules. 
*   Signing patches. Do we want to runtime verify security patches?
    *   Should dependent modules (on the security patches) have to re-sign?
    *   Or does someone need to sign the linkage, not the contents.
    *   A linkage (importing multiple modules) can be a small module that you can sign
*   Do we need to preserve signatures on reordered modules?
*   Historically, there was a discussion around providing a manifest (for preallocation byte sizes). An argument against requiring a manifest ahead of time was for streaming/unknown cases. 
*   Target is that May 8th presentation in the CG
    *   TODO[asraa]: Move meeting process + agenda to the repo
